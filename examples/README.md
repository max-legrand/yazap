# Yazap examples

To build them please run:
```sh
zig build examples
```

When the compilation finishes you can run any example
as an usual executable file, for example:
```sh
./zig-out/bin/touch --no-create it-works
```

All if the examples come with a `--help` page which
can also be displayed with `-h`, as follows:
```sh
./zig-out/bin/touch -h
```
